# Speech Recognition and Synthesis Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems using popular deep learning libraries and audio processing tools.

## Features

- Audio processing utilities using Librosa and SciPy
- Speech recognition using DeepSpeech and TensorFlow
- Speech synthesis using Tacotron and TensorFlow
- Basic training pipelines for ASR and TTS models

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```

git clone https://github.com/kzebibi/Speech-Recognition-and-Synthesis-Project.git
cd speech_project

```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`

```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Usage

1. Update the file paths in `main.py` to point to your models and audio files.

2. Run the main script:

```

python [main.py](http://main.py/)

```

This will demonstrate basic ASR and TTS functionality, as well as simplified model training.

## Components

### Audio Processing (`utils/audio_processing.py`)

Contains utility functions for loading, preprocessing, and synthesizing audio using Librosa and SciPy.

### Speech Recognition (`asr/speech_recognition.py`)

Implements a speech recognition model using DeepSpeech and includes a simple training function using TensorFlow.

### Speech Synthesis (`tts/speech_synthesis.py`)

Implements a text-to-speech model using Tacotron and includes a simple training function using TensorFlow.

## Extending the Project

- Implement more advanced audio preprocessing techniques
- Experiment with different model architectures for ASR and TTS
- Add support for multiple languages
- Implement real-time ASR and TTS capabilities
- Integrate with a web or mobile application
